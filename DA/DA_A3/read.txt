check hadoop version :
hadoop version.

start hadoop

create input_data folder and input.txt

create new folder to hold java class :
	create java_classes folder

export hadoop classpath :
todo :->
export HADOOP_HOME="/usr/local/Cellar/hadoop" # Replace with your own path
export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=$(find $HADOOP_HOME -name '*.jar' | xargs echo | tr ' ' ':')

	export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=$(hadoop classpath)

check : 	echo $HADOOP_CLASSPATH

create dir on hdfs :
hadoop fs -mkdir /WordCount
hadoop fs -mkdir -p /WordCount

hadoop fs -mkdir /WordCount/Input

check on :		localhost:50070

putting input file to hdfs dir
	hadoop fs -put 'home/Folder/Input_data/input.txt' /WordCount/Input

change current directory to word count folder dir
cd /Workspace/WordCount

compiling the java code :
	javac -classpath ${HADOOP_CLASSPATH} -d '/home/java_classes' '/home/WordCount/WordCount.java' 

making jar :
	jar -cvf count.jar -C java_classes/ .

now run jar file on haddop :
	hadoop jar '/home/Workspace/WordCount/count.jar' WordCount /WordCount/Input /WordCount/Output 

now see output
	hadoop dfs -cat /WordCount/Output/*
